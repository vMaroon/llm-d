# generate-shared-prefix-traffic.sh — Tutorial traffic generator for llm-d
#
# Sends requests with shared prefixes to demonstrate the routing difference
# between vanilla k8s round-robin and llm-d prefix-cache-aware scheduling.
#
# Usage:
#   ./generate-shared-prefix-traffic.sh [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   -e ENDPOINT    Base URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
#   -m MODEL       Model name (default: random)
#   -d DURATION    Duration in seconds (default: 120)
#   -r RATE        Requests per second (default: 5)
#   -p PREFIXES    Number of distinct shared prefixes (default: 3)
#   -h             Show help
